    <h1>ROAD NOT TAKEN</h1>
    <H2>Poem</H2>
    <P>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<BR>
        And sorry I could not travel both<BR>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<BR>
        And looked down one as far as I could<BR>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<BR>
        
        Then took the other, as just as fair,<BR>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<BR>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<BR>
        Though as for that the passing there<BR>
        Had worn them really about the same,<BR>
        
        And both that morning equally lay<BR>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<BR>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<BR>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<BR>
        I doubted if I should ever come back.<BR>
        </P>
